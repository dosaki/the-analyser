# The Analyser (working title, I guess?)
This is a game developed for [js13kgames 2018 competition](https://2018.js13kgames.com/) where the theme is "**Offline**".

# About
Your job is to analyse several AIs that have been flagged as behaving erratically.
To this end you're given a tool that can interact with these pieces of software in order to diagnose and judge wether or not they should be brought offline or if they're fit for duty.

Remember: They are just pieces of software. Erratic behaviour can cost human lives.
